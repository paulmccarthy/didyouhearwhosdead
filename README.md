# Did you hear who died?
If you're Irish (as I am), you reach a stage in your life when you call your parents, and after the usual chit chat
(Are you eating enough? Yeah. Are you getting enough sleep? Yeah.), you'll get the dreaded question:

Mother: Did you hear who died?<br />

Me: [Deep breath] No, who's dead now?<br />
Mother: Remember Mary that lived down the road?<br />
Me: No...<br />
Mother: Ah you do, she had the cat with the wonky leg?<br />
Me: No...<br />
Mother: Ah you do, you used to cry every time you saw the cat?<br />
Me: Still no idea who that is...<br />
Mother: She was my second cousin, she was at your Christening...<br />
Me: I was 3 months old...<br />
Mother: Ah you do know her, anyway, her sister died. She went into the hospital on Friday and died on Saturday. Went very quick.<br />
Me: Right...<br />
Mother: The funeral is tomorrow, will you be going?<br />
Me: Don't think I can, I have to work.<br />
Mother: I'll get a Mass card and put your name on it.<br />

This website will provide a list of notable deaths that have happened today, so when you get the dreaded question, you'll be able to give an answer.
